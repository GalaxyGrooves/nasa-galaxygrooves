Our submission, Galaxy Grooves, is for the 2023 NASA Space Apps Challenge Open Source Hackathon. The challenge we tackled is [Immersed in the Sounds of Space](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2023/challenges/immersed-in-the-sounds-of-space/), where we aimed to represent a high dimensional dataset into an audio output.
